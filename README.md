# Locize Diff Action

GitHub Action to display a diff of translations for two Locize versions.

![Example comments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Widen/locize-diff/main/screenshot.png)

## Inputs

### `projectId`

Locize project id. You can find your `projectId` in your project settings under the **Api Keys** tab. **Required**

### `apiKey`

Locize API key. You can find your `apiKey` in your project settings under the **Api Keys** tab. **Required**

### `projectSlug`

Locize project slug. Used to provide a quick link in the comment to navigate directly to the project settings for quick publishing.

### `leftVersion`

Locize version to use as the left side of the comparision. Default: `'latest'`

### `rightVersion`

Locize version to use as the right side of the comparision. Default: `'production'`

### `ignoreDeletedKeys`

> This action assumes that your Locize keys originate from `leftVersion` and are then copied to `rightVersion` when publishing to production. Keys that are missing in `rightVersion` are likely unpublished keys and thus this action will mark them as a diff. However, keys that are missing in `leftVersion` are likely deleted keys which won't have a negative impact if they are not deleted from `rightVersion`.

If you wish to also mark deleted keys as a diff, set this input to `false`. Default: `true`

### `token`

`GITHUB_TOKEN` used to authenticate requests. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. Default: `${{ github.token }}`

## Commands

In addition to running on pull request events, this action also is setup to watch issue or pull request comments so you can manually trigger specific commands on-demand. The available commands and their usage are detailed below.

### `@locize-diff check`

This command will perform the same steps that run when you commit changes. Additionally, it will respond to your request with a comment explaining if the existing comment was updated, no diffs were found, or if an old comment was resolved. To run this command, create a comment with the following text:

```
@locize-diff check
```

### `@locize-diff copy`
