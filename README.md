# Locize Diff Action

GitHub Action to display a diff of translations for two Locize versions.

## Inputs

### `projectId`

Locize project id. You can find your `projectId` in your project settings under the **Api Keys** tab.

### `leftVersion`

Locize version to use as the left side of the comparision. Default: `'latest'`

### `rightVersion`

Locize version to use as the right side of the comparision. Default: `'production'`

### `ignoreDeletedKeys`

> This action assumes that your Locize keys originate from `leftVersion` and are then copied to `rightVersion` when publishing to production. Keys that are missing in `rightVersion` are likely unpublished keys and thus this action will mark them as a diff. However, keys that are missing in `leftVersion` are likely deleted keys which won't have a negative impact if they are not deleted from `rightVersion`.

If you wish to also mark deleted keys as a diff, set this input to `false`. Default: `true`

### `includeDrafts`

When `true`, will run the action on draft PRs. Default: `false`

### `token`

`GITHUB_TOKEN` used to authenticate requests. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. Default: `${{ github.token }}`

## Usage

> Note: We recommend running this action with the `pull_request` event.
